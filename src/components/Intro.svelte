        Welcome to the Abstract Play game designer playground. This is a place
        for game designers, where you can generate a board and some pieces and
        move things around to design new games. This is <i>not</i> a place for
        coding games for Abstract Play. This page does no rule enforcement. It's
        simply a place to interact with the
        <a href="https://github.com/AbstractPlay/renderer"
            >Abstract Play renderer</a
        >.
    </p>
    <p>
        This service is restricted to the boards and pieces currently offered in
        the Abstract Play rendering engine. To request changes and additions,
        please join us on the <a href="http://discord.abstractplay.com"
            >Abstract Play Discord server</a
        >.

        Simply work through the tabs from left to right. First you choose your
        board, then you choose your pieces, then you can add/remove pieces on
        the board in the Play tab. The JSON tab reflects your current state. You
        can copy and paste that somewhere if you want to save it to load again
        later.
